# Jekyll configuration: exclude project source files (Astro) so Jekyll
# doesn't try to parse .astro frontmatter during GitHub Pages builds.
exclude:
  - "src"
  - "node_modules"
  - "package.json"
  - "package-lock.json"
  - "pnpm-lock.yaml"
  - "README.md"

# If you later want Jekyll to process a specific directory, remove it from
# the exclude list above.
