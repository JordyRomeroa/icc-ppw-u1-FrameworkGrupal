# Repository-level Jekyll config to prevent Jekyll from parsing Astro source files
# The GitHub Action runs at the repository root; placing this file here ensures
# Jekyll will exclude the Astro project files and won't try to parse `.astro`
# frontmatter.
exclude:
  - "**/*.astro"
  - "astro-romero_barbecho/**"
  - "node_modules"
  - "package.json"
  - "package-lock.json"
  - "pnpm-lock.yaml"
  - "README.md"

# If you later want Jekyll to process specific directories, remove them from
# the exclude list above.
